# Plant Gene Associations
Machine learning using single cell genomics of plant-associated bacteria

We use data of 3867 COG-annotated bacterial genomes provided by Levy et. al. 
By clustering these genomes together based on taxonomic similarity, we hope to obtain groups of 
highly-related bacteria, namely plant-associated bacteria which may yield symbiotic
relationships with agricultural crops. By obtaining the genes unique to these plant-associated bacteria,
we identify genes of interest that may be responsible for the formation of bacterial natural products that defer advantages 
for agricultural crops in the form of pest resistance, without the need for commercial pesticides.

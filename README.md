# Plant Gene Associations
Machine learning using single cell genomics of plant-associated bacteria
Introduction:

This project is based off data of 3867 annotated bacterial genomes with their corresponding genes in the form of COG ids, 
provided by Levy et. al. By clustering these genomes together based on taxonomic similarity, we hope to obtain groups of 
highly-related bacteria. Of these, we are interested in plant-associated bacteria which may be responsible for symbiotic
relationships with plants, namely agricultural crops. By obtaining the genes unique to these plant-associated bacteria,
we identify genes of interest that may be responsible for the formation of bacterial natural products that defer advantages 
for agricultural crops in the form of pest resistance, without the need for commercial pesticides.
